Notes: 

Scales
"decide how D3 maps data values to pixel values. Put another way, a scale is simply a function that maps an input range to an output domain”

Scott Murray:
“When I say "input," you say "domain." Then I say "output," and you say "range." Ready? Okay:
Input! Domain!”


Selections are the core of everything we do with D3--d3.select is used to select a single element, while d3.selectAll creates an array-like selection with multiple elements.
